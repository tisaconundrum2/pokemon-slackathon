## Welcome to the Pokemon Slackathon. 

This readme is setup as a brainstorming area, as well as an area for how to setup our bot if you're interested.

## Basic Ideas So Far
   - user engagement required to gain Pokeballs
   - go to `safari` channel to use pokeballs and catch pokemon 
   - Pokemon could level up through a PokemonGo like style
   - OR simplified twist - catching multiple of the same pokemon goes towards leveling that pokemon up?
   - simple web application to manage team (something like /poketeam will post your team in slack for others to see).

## Utilizing the Poke API

The Poke API is a very versatile API, it will be a great way to get images up on screen and stats about each Pokemon.
